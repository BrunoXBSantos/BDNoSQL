  The present project consists of the analysis, planning and implementation of a relational and two non-relational database management system. To this end, the database in the HR relational model, made available on Oracle, was adapted for two non-relational models, one of the NoSQL databases being used oriented to documents, MongoDB, and the other oriented to graphs, Neo4j.
